# Palindromo
Creating my first JavaScript project, putting it into test on github. I used the basic knowledge obtained in the courses I've been taking.
<br>A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that remains the same when read backwards. By extension, a palindrome is any series of elements with linear symmetry, that is, which has the same sequence of units in both directions.
